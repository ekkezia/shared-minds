# Wake Up
I’m creating an interface that only renders when user is closing their eyes. The media to be rendered is a webcam stream, which essentially shows the user in it as well. Such interaction defeats the traditional idea of an interface (to ) because user cannot see the message on the screen when they closes their eyes. This kind of interaction shuts down the input for visual perceptions. The interface subverts the idea where “an interaction is needed for a connection (e.g, messages, video stream) to happen” into “an interaction is needed for the user to omit the connection itself”. In this case, the interaction is the act of closing the eyes or shutting down one’s visual perception, and the connection to be omitted is seeing the camera stream which will display the user.
